# Artificial-Neural-Net-for-Pong-Game-with-Non-Player-Character (NPC)

This is an example in Unit 2018.4.11f1 that uses an Artificial Neural Network that learns to play pong.
The neural network was constructed using C# as part of the deep learning course with Unity thaught by Dr. Penny de Bly
The network consists of six inputs:
1. the ball x-velocity
2. the ball y-velocity
3. the ball x-position
4. the ball y-position
5. the paddle x-position
6. the paddle y-position
One output:
1. the paddle y-velocity

The network has one hidden layer and uses the TanH activation function ih the hidden and output layers
The network's learning rate that worked well was 0.11 (which is rather low(,
